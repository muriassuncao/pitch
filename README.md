#Research:
Last year, the The Hetrick Martin Institute (HMI) launched a citywide initiative designed to bring mental health and support services to homeless LGBTQ youth across the five boroughs. Kids who are thrown out of their house, or who run away fearing violence simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

HMI is the largest and oldest non-profit agency in the nation to serve LGBTQ youth. It works towards shaping policies and providing support services and comprehensive mental health for more than 2,000 kids and young adults (ages 13-24) annually. Today, it operates mainly in Manhattan and Newark, but the goal is to expand its services to young people across all five boroughs. 

The statistics are pretty scary: more than 80 percent of HMI youth live at or below the poverty line. Their HIV infection rates are three times higher than the national average. 

Nationally, a 2012 study by UCLA’s Williams Institute estimated that as many as 40% of homeless youth identify as LGBTQ. In New York City, according to a 2015 Urban Institute report, LGBTQ kids are seven times more likely to trade sex for a place to spend the night than their heterosexual counterparts. For transgender youth, it’s even worse: they are eight times more likely. LGBTQ kids are also 3 times more likely to attempt suicide then their straight peers.

But there is help out there. The problem is that a lot of kids don’t even know about it.

The main idea for this project is, then, to partner up with an organization such as the HMI (other ideas: Trevor Project, Ali Forney, GSLEN, itgetsbetter.org, True Colors Fund), and help to spread the word. Reach out to at-risk youth and let them know what services are available to them. So, if a kid gets beaten up, bullied at school, discriminated against, thrown out of his/her home or if they are thinking about running away from home, we need to let them know there’s help.

A few possible ideas:

1.	Interactive maps showing what’s around them, and when events will happen.

2.	Provide a way to help kids connect with other kids like them. Networking.

3.	People who’ve been through that experience before can share their stories. Hope is fundamental!

4.	Health/HIV advice.

5.	Trans issues.

6.	Some kind of video chat, or regular video-conference calls led by a social worker.

7.	A “counter” showing some statistics about crimes/episodes/solutions that are happening on each borough.

8.	A safe place (forum? Wall?) where kids can talk to a social worker about bulling, harassment etc 

9.	Some of it could be tricky, though. Some kids are still afraid of coming out, and won’t even admit to themselves. We’d also have to come up with a workaround: how can we sell this idea to a kid who doesn’t even want (or who’s afraid) to admit he/she is LGBTQ?
